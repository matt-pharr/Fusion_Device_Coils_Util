# OMFIT_coilsutil

A utility to manipulate coils that can be used for [OMFIT](https://omfit.io/)/[GPEC](https://omfit.io/modules/mod_GPEC.html) applications. Primary functions are to 

- Convert between OMFIT and GPEC formats
- Read STEP file formats (to interface with CAD programs)
- Draw thin or thick coils based on various conditions
- Shift/tilt coils to model imperfect coil placement or movement
- More stuff as I need it

Let me know if this ends up being useful for you!
